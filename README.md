## üìú Scripts

Below are the scripts you'll need to run and package your application, as well as build out JSDoc documentation, if you choose to do so. An exhaustive list of scripts that are available can be found in the `package.json` file of the project's root directory, in the `scripts` section.

**Start Developer Mode:**
```bash
yarn run start
```
